= Introduction

Arrata is a roleplaying system inspired by the work of more traditional
roleplaying games with an emphasis on universality. The purpose of this system
is to allow you to collaboratively write interesting, nuanced, and fun stories
easily with multiple people - all through the guise of playing a game.

Arrata comes with no setting; I believe it is better to create something of your
own and flesh it out as you go along. That's characters, the world, and the
context in which those all interact, you will be able to do things far more
suited to your understanding than I ever could by building your own worlds and
defining their rules (or #strike[stealing] borrowing them).

Doing things is often far more valuable and teachable than observing or being
told them. Part of the learning-by-doing process is that in order to learn, _you must fail_.
This is natural, expected, and not something to be upset or sad about. You _will also succeed_,
although rarely in the manner you may be expecting. The great thing about
fictional worlds is that they have no physical consequence - they cannot and
will not hurt you, so you are free to try the things you want to, and to fail
and succeed in amazing and interesting ways.

== Other Worlds

In using this system, a fictional world is constructed by a _Game Master_ (GM).
This world is populated with characters and given things like factions, peoples,
places, and conflict; things that make the world alive and interactable. _Players_ take
control of _Player Characters_ (PCs) who are built with _Quirks_ that define who
they are as people, and _Stats_ that define what they are as beings in the
world. Together, the players and GM create a story with the PCs as the
protagonists; their actions being influenced by their Quirks and the outcomes of
their decisions determined by their Stats.

  _The word Arrata is a misspelling of errata, the plural of erratum; a list of
  mistakes in a written document. The word was chosen as it embodies the spirit of
  Arrata: *Change Through Purpose*. By failing; making mistakes and blunders, you
  will develop as a person and become better than before. I hope in some way this
  system will allow you to explore these ideas, and perhaps even learn how you can
  change yourself._

== Examples

This book contains many examples of different systems and situations, and for
your convenience, each example will be enclosed in a box with a title, and will
look like this:

  _Note: notes often describe intrinsic rules or behaviors._
   
  This is an example. Have the Gamma function:
   
  $ Gamma(x) = integral_(0)^(infinity)t^(x-1)e^(-1) dif x $

== Game Masters

Game Masters (GMs) are a critical part of any roleplaying system. Their job is
to:

- Understand the rules as thoroughly as possible.
- Roleplay Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
- Be courteous and fair to their Players.
- Provide a story, conflict, and setting.
- Arbitrate Player and gameplay conflicts.
- Describe:
  - The outcomes of rolls.
  - The environment.
  - NPCs and their actions.
  - Reactions and consequences.

The GM is the world engine, describing and defining what the world is, how it
looks, smells, tastes, and sounds, and how it interacts with the Players'
Characters and their actions.

As a GM, you have the most responsibility; orchestrating sessions and campaigns,
managing NPCs, handling disputes, etc. Your Players are counting on you to
prepare and improvise as well as you can. If the responsibility required is too
much for you to handle, I suggest being a Player. There isn't anything wrong
with not being a GM, but having a bad GM is a million times worse than having a
bad Player.

Game Masters are to be afforded extra rights over the Players. They will have to
make rulings and decisions for the Players, and should act as a mediator; thus
these rulings are to be respected and treated as the new rule of law unless
otherwise changed by the GM.

However, it is important not to overstep your authority as the GM. Punishing
Players unfairly or making nonsensical rulings are unacceptable. If you find
yourself under a GM making such decisions, the best course of action is
typically to discuss the issue with the other Players and GM. Mediation and
communication are critical skills in roleplaying, but if you fail to solve your
issues, it's usually best to leave the group altogether.

== Players and their Characters

Players are the people in charge of player characters (PCs); their job is to be
the "soul" driving their character. Players are charged with the following
responsibilities:

- Roleplaying their character.
- Being courteous to the Game Master and fellow players.
- Knowing the rules.
- Following the rules and decisions of the Game Master.
- Being honest about rolls, outcomes, and and their character.

PCs are the protagonists of any Arrata game. They exist to provide a player with
a point of view on the collective story being told, and to allow that player to
interact with the story. Their PC is the primary responsibility of the Player,
and thus if a conflict arises regarding your PC, it is the duty of the Player to
back up their PC and fight on their behalf.

== Non-Player Characters
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are characters in the story created by the GM or
players that act without player input. Instead, the GM acts as the "soul" of
every NPC and treats one of many of their characters. 

GMs can generate hundreds or even thousands of NPCs throughout long campaigns,
so NPCs that are underdeveloped or single-purpose are acceptable as long as they
are not used in a derogatory or offensive manner.
