### What is Arrata?
The word Arrata is a misspelling of errata, the plural of erratum; a list of mistakes in a written document.

Entomology aside, Arrata is a Tabletop-Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) system with a focus on meaningful characters and their development. To emphasize, Arrata is a <i>system</i>, designed with tools to allow it to be used in many different settings. There are some tools for playing in more fantastical settings provided, but Arrata is certainly not limited to them.

### What is Roleplaying?
Roleplaying is the act of putting yourself in the shoes of someone else. It's a form of improv where your job is to emulate and represent a character. There are many parts to roleplaying, such as the accent the character has, the ways they interact with different people, how they solve problems, etc.

Anyone roleplaying a character should know as much about that character as they can if they hope to provide a reliable and accurate representation of them, and Arrata provides many tools that allow you to do this, along with helping you develop that character as they experience new things.

### Game Masters (GMs)
Game Masters (GMs) are a critical part of any roleplaying system. Their job is to:
- Understand the system as thoroughly as possible.
- Roleplay Non-Player Characters (NPCs, also called Non-Playable Characters).
- Be courteous and fair to their Players.
- Provide a story and setting.
- Describe:
	- the outcomes of rolls,
	- the environment,
	- reactions and consequences,
	- everything that isn't already known and is wanted to be know.

The GM's job is to be the world-engine, describing and defining what the world is, how it looks, and how it interacts with the players and their actions.

As a GM, you have the most responsibility as you must know and/or improv everything the players and their characters will come to discover in your world. You also have the most amount of power, it's important to keep things fair and reasonable. It's also your job to act responsibly as a mediator if any disagreement or argument happens related to the game. The GM's rulings are absolute, so be sure to write them down if you know you'll come across them again.

GMs typically orchestrate Campaigns and Sessions, which is an added layer of responsibility. To compensate this, they are afforded the right to remove Players they think are a poor fit or are being a nusance to the group.

### Players and their Characters (PCs)
Players are people whose job it is to roleplay their character, and their characters are what the story being told follows.

That may seem simple, but being a player has a lot different demands and expectations, including but not limited to:
- Roleplaying their character.
- Being courteous to the Game Master and fellow players.
- Knowing the rules within reason.
- Following the rules and decisions of the Game Master.
- Being honest about rolls and their character sheet.

Being a bad player is more than enough reason for a Game Master to remove them from their game - as a player you are owed nothing but the fate your rolls provide you.

That doesn't mean that rolling bad should get you kicked - being an asshole will. Be reasonable, be understanding, and communicate with your GM if you have questions or concerns.

On top of being a Player, you are assigned a **Player Character** (PC), which you will often times have the ability to create yourself. Your PC is the way in which you interact with the world, so do try to keep good care of them.

In order to know what and who your PC is, you should probably record the information somewhere, perhaps on the [Official Arrata Character sheet]()?

### How Should I Play Arrata?
Arrata can be played in many different ways, but king amongst them is the TT part of TTRPG; sitting at a table with friends (or soon-to-be friends). Being face-to-face offers a lot of advantages in how you roleplay your character and act as a Game Master, not to mention how helpful if can be be in growing your social skills. It also allows you to roll dice and use your character sheet rather easily with people who can help and answer questions immediately next to you.

However, there are situations where being in-person is very difficult or even impossible. As such, there are many platforms online that can offer you solutions, especially those that allow voice chat capabilities. Playing Arrata over text is not advised as you can often lose out on the nuances and fun that real-time roleplay offer, but it is possible.

There are also dice rolling capabilities online that are easily accessed that can help offer a solution if a GM does not trust or want their Players rolling in an incognito manner.

### Sessions
Like many TTRPGs, it's advised to play Arrata in **sessions**. That is, getting everyone playing the game together and playing for an extended period, usually for a minimum of an hour and up to 4, though I've certainly gone far past that. Some people have 24-hour sessions which is a daunting and exhausting task, but having an single, relatively uninterrupted session has its benefits, few they may seem to be.

Make sure to get up and stretch when playing for extended periods of time - dying of a blood clot might not be modeled exactly in Arrata, but it is in real life.

### A Quick Note - Division
Whenever any division or decimal value is made in this document (½, ⅓, etc.) always round up if the decimal is 0.5 or higher and always round down if the decimal is less than 0.5. 
<br>\>= ½ -> 1
<br>\< ½ -> 0
