# III Character Setup
## Who Are They?
A character is a actor in the story who commits actions and changes. The following section provides an overview of different elements to a character, but does not necessarily go into depth with them. Specifically, Quirks and Argos, as well as Stats and Skills are discussed in detail later on.

### Cosmetic Details
When creating a character, there are many different bits and pieces that may not have a mechanical effect, but might be very useful to help you roleplay them. Here's a list of some (but not all) of the cosmetic details a character might have:
- Name; what do we refer to them as? Do they also have any pseudonyms?
- Age; how old are they?
- Sex/Gender; what are they packing, and what do they identify as?
- Role; what sort of occupation, party role, or term best describes the character?
- Physical description; things like their height, weight, hair and skin color, hair style, etc. What do they look like?


### History
While a character's past is technically cosmetic, it's important they do have one. Placing them into a world with no history can lead to an underdeveloped and probably uninteresting character. When defining their history, consider the following, and consult your GM;
- What setting are they in?
- What sort of technology do they have access to?
- How rich were they?
- What relatives of theirs remain?
- How did they get to where they are now?
- Why do they have the Stats/Skills/Quirks they have now?

Having a history is kind of like a cover letter - you're less likely to have your application thrown in the trash. Even if it's barely anything, the GM can always help you expand upon it and even incorporate characters you create within it into the story. 


### Stock
This is an element that depends on the setting the GM creates. It's the GM's job to provide a list of playable Stocks. 

Stocks are the race, species, or category of *thing* your character is. Think Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Humans. Stocks have a relatively muted role in Arrata, they don't offer any Stat or Skill boons innately. Instead, Stocks will usually provide a Quirk (discussed next) unique to that Stock. 

## Quirks
Quirks are an integral part of any character. They're usually a one to two word descriptor of a particular characteristic. Each Quirk is broken down into 3 pieces of information:
- Defines: Different interpretations and possible meanings of the Quirk, specific to roleplaying scenarios.
- Boons: Ways in which the Quirk can be used to your Advantage.
- Flaws: Ways the Quirk can work towards your Disadvantage.
