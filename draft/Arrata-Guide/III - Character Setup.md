# III Character Setup

## Who Are They?

A character is a actor in the story who commits actions and changes. The following section provides an overview of different elements to a character, but does not necessarily go into depth with them. Specifically, Quirks and Argos, as well as Stats and Skills are discussed in detail later on.

### Cosmetic Details

When creating a character, there are many different bits and pieces that may not have a mechanical effect, but might be very useful to help you roleplay them. Here's a list of some (but not all) of the cosmetic details a character might have:

- Name; what do we refer to them as? Do they also have any pseudonyms?
- Age; how old are they?
- Sex/Gender; what are they packing, and what do they identify as?
- Role; what sort of occupation, party role, or term best describes the character?
- Physical description; things like their height, weight, hair and skin color, hair style, etc. What do they look like?

### History

While a character's past is technically cosmetic, it's important they do have one. Placing them into a world with no history can lead to an underdeveloped and probably uninteresting character. When defining their history, consider the following, and consult your GM;

- What setting are they in?
- What sort of technology do they have access to?
- How rich were they?
- What relatives of theirs remain?
- How did they get to where they are now?
- Why do they have the Stats/Skills/Quirks they have now?

Having a history is kind of like a cover letter - you're less likely to have your application thrown in the trash. Even if it's barely anything, the GM can always help you expand upon it and even incorporate characters you create within it into the story.

### Stock

This is an element that depends on the setting the GM creates. It's the GM's job to provide a list of playable Stocks.

Stocks are the race, species, or category of *thing* your character is. Think Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Humans. Stocks have a relatively muted role in Arrata, they don't offer any Stat or Skill boons innately. Instead, Stocks will usually provide a Quirk (discussed next) unique to that Stock.

## Quirks

Quirks are an integral part of any character. They're usually a one to two word descriptor of a particular characteristic. Each Quirk is broken down into 4 pieces of information:

- Name: The name of the Quirk.
- Defines: Different interpretations and possible meanings of the Quirk, specific to roleplaying scenarios.
- Boons: Ways in which the Quirk can be used to your Advantage.
- Flaws: Ways the Quirk can work towards your Disadvantage.

Each Quirk is sorted into one of three rhetorical categories: Ethos, Pathos, or Logos.

### Ethos

Ethos Quirks express a characterâ€™s Ethical, Moral, Societal, and Religious beliefs and context. Often it contains information about their past and how they're currently seen by the society they live in today.

### Pathos

Pathos deals with how a character is emotionally - how they act around other people and with what level of apathy or empathy they approach different tasks. It tends to define things that may seem simple but can be used in much more nuanced ways when combined with other Quirks.

### Logos

Logos is how a character makes decisions; how they choose to solve problems and treat other people.

Many Logos and Pathos Quirks are very similar, but their differentiation lies in what level they derive their reasoning for an action. Logos Quirks are innate - Pathos Quirks are artifacts of personality and culture.

### Argos

In Greek mythology, the Argonauts were a band of heroes that suffered through and completed a four-month journey to fetch the Golden Fleece. In much the same light, Argos shall be that grand quest; the goal for which our characters fight and suffer dearly.

Argos is a statement. A declaration about the true intent and desire the character has. It acts as a sort of 4th component of Quirks, one which you as a player will have to define for your character on your own.

Only one ARGOS may be had at any time, and:

- It must relate to at least one Quirk.
- It must be something the character would say or think.
- It must not be something in reach.
- It must be of great worth to the character.
- It must be a call to action.

Argos is your character's mission. In many TTRPGs, the objective may seem detatched from what the characters believe and want, but in Arrata the objective is defined around a character. As a player, your Argos is your goal - complete it at all costs.
