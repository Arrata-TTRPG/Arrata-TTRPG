# III Character Setup

## Who Are They?

A character is an actor in the story who commits actions and changes. The following section provides an overview of different elements to a character, but does not necessarily go into depth with them. Specifically, Quirks and Argos, as well as Stats and Skills are discussed in detail later on.

### Cosmetic Details

When creating a character, there are many different bits and pieces that may not have a mechanical effect, but might be very useful to help you roleplay them. Here's a list of some (but not all) of the cosmetic details a character might have:

- Name; what do we refer to them as? Do they also have any pseudonyms?
- Age; how old are they?
- Sex/Gender; what are they packing, and what do they identify as?
- Role; what sort of occupation, party role, or term best describes the character?
- Physical description; things like their height, weight, hair and skin color, hairstyle, etc. What do they look like?

### History

While a character's past is technically cosmetic, they must have one. Placing them in a world with no history can lead to an underdeveloped and probably uninteresting character. When defining their history, consider the following, and consult your GM;

- What setting are they in?
- What sort of technology do they have access to?
- How rich were they?
- What relatives of theirs remain?
- How did they get to where they are now?
- Why do they have the Stats/Skills/Quirks they have now?

Having a history is kind of like a cover letter - you're less likely to have your application thrown in the trash. Even if it's barely anything, the GM can always help you expand upon it and even incorporate characters you create within it into the story.

### Stock

This is an element that depends on the setting the GM creates. It's the GM's job to provide a list of playable Stocks.

Stocks are the race, species, or category of *thing* your character is. Think Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, and Humans. Stocks have a relatively muted role in Arrata, they don't offer any Stat or Skill boons innately. Instead, Stocks will usually provide a Quirk (discussed next) unique to that Stock.

## Quirks

Quirks are an integral part of any character. They're usually a one to two-word descriptor of a particular characteristic. Each Quirk is broken down into 4 pieces of information:

- Name: The name of the Quirk.
- Defines: Different interpretations and possible meanings of the Quirk, specific to roleplaying scenarios.
- Boons: Ways in which the Quirk can be used to your Advantage.
- Flaws: Ways the Quirk can work towards your Disadvantage.

Quirks are expanded on in the next section, IV - Quirks.

## Argos

Argos is the primary goal of a character. It defines their motivation to be on the current journey; the reason why they suffer and fail, risk life and limb, and fight tooth and nail. This is what you should have in the back of your mind at all times when roleplaying a character.

## Stats

**Stats** here refers to the primary, non-Skill statistics of the character. These are the attributes and values that define your character roughly, and allow you to derive Major Skills.

Stats are usually employed to roll against more rudimentary checks, such as dodging an attack, resisting poisons and toxins, pushing a large object, etc.

Stats have 3 components:

- **Name**: The name of the Stat.
- **Stat**: The Quality and Quantity of the Stat.
- **Checks**: The number of checks made with the Stat, used for leveling.

A character has 6 primary Stats, grouped into 3 mental and 3 physical Stats:

Mental:

- **Will**
  - General knowledge, mental health, and willpower.
- **Perception**
  - Ability to perceive and detect things.
- **Conscious**
  - Ability to process and understand information.

Physical:

- **Power**
  - Physical strength and capability.
- **Speed**
  - Dexterity and swiftness.
- **Forte**
  - Physical health and conditioning.

There are several auxiliary Stats are well:

- **Armor**
  - Used in Defense rolls, this is much armor a character has.
- **Injuries**
  - How many physical/mental wounds the character has.
  - Broken down into 3 categories:
    - Stingers - Small cuts and bruises, usually annoying but not fatal.
    - Wounds - Broken bones, deep cuts, major bleeding. These can evolve and eventually lead to death if untreated.
    - Fatal Wounds - A catastrophic Injury, usually able to knock someone out. Death will occur without immediate medical intervention.
- **Fatigue**
  - A measure of magical/physical/mental tiredness. These have a negative effect on Forte and Will rolls.

All of these stats are expanded on later on in V - Stats and Skills.

### Skills

**Skills** make up the majority of the way characters interact with the world. They're a type of Stat used in very specific situations.

There are an infinite number of Skills in Arrata, as none are inherently defined, but an Appendix is included at the end that details a number of potentially useful Skills. These are also included on the [Official Arrata Character Sheet]().

Skills have 4 components, including the ones from Stats as discussed before:

- **Root**: What Stats the Skill is derived from.
- **Name**: The name of the Skill.
- **Stat**: The Quality and Quantity of the Skill. Written as \[**First letter of the Quality**]\[**Quantity**].
- **Checks**: The number of checks made with the Skill, used for leveling.

To review:

- Characters are actors that make choices in a story. They both influence and are influenced by their story.
  - Characters are made of several parts;
    - Cosmetics: Things like age, appearance, role, weight, etc. They may have some impact on roleplay, but won't have a defined mechanical effect.
    - Stock: What race, species, or specific group the character comes from. These often come with a designated Quirk.
    - Quirks: Qualities of their personality and past, who they are. Quirks are organized into Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.
      - Argos: Your character's **goal**, the thing they want to accomplish by the end of this story.
    - Stats: Values quantifying different aspects of what they are. These include auxiliary stats such as Fatigue and Armor.
      - Skills: Stats used for specific activities
