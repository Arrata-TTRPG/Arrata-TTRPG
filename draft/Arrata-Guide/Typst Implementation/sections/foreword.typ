= Foreword

Arrata is a project I've been working on for a few years now, and it's the successor to some other custom TTRPGs I've worked on with friends. There's a lot here that is currently under development, so take much of what you read with a grain of salt; it's all subject to change until a v1.0 release is made.

That said, a lot of things here are built from my experience. I've been a GM for 5 years now and I mostly see things from that point of view. I write this system with the bias that I want the systems to be as easy for me to use, the players to act, speak, and work together how I want them to. Thus, the wording of things here will be jargon-ful. If you find things that are disagreeable, you believe could be improved, you think should just be better, or if you have any questions at all, _please_, email me at: `kaleb.r.burris@gmail.com` with the title `Arrata - Suggestions/Fixes/Criticisms/Questions` and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hopefully you'll see your change and name (if you so choose) in the changelog and credits.

I value criticism and learning from your mistakes; it's major part of Arrata, and I would be a fool to write such a system yet fail to act in a way that demonstrates those principles.
