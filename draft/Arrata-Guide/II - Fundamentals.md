# II - Fundamentals

## Dice Notation

When using and discussing quantities of dice, often the term Dice Notation may be used. This refers to a system that helps define two things about the dice being rolled:

- How many dice are being rolled.
- How many sides the dice being rolled have.

This is represented as \[**# of dice being rolled**]**d**\[**sides of the dice being rolled**].
For instance, if you wanted to roll 3 dice with 20 sides each, you'd say you were rolling 3d20 and pronounce it "*three-dee-twenty*".

In addition, if you see +1D or -1D, this refers to adding or subtracting 1 from the \[**# of dice being rolled**].
For instance, if you were rolling 3d20 -1D, you're really rolling 2d20. If you rolled 3d20 +1D, you're rolling 4d20.

## Dice Pools - Quantity

Arrata is an RPG system that relies on **dice pools**, using the **d6** or *6-sided-die*.
This means that a number representing a stat or skill is the number representing how many 6-sided-dice are to be rolled when using that stat or skill.

This number shall be refered to as **Quantity** - the number of dice to be rolled.

In dice notation, this makes up the \[**#of dice to be rolled**] section, which we can shorten to \[*Quantity*]d6, as again, Arrata uses the d6 for its dice rolls.

Quality represents how much work a person can do with a stat or skill, along with how knowledgable they are in the subject.

## Success and Failure - Quality

With dice pools, a critical mechanic is called **Quality**, this value determines the odds of each die being rolled. It defines how high each die must be rolled to as a minimum for said die to be counted as a **Success**. Any dice not considered a success are called **Failures**.

There are 3 levels of Quality. From least to most:
**B**asic: Roll 4 or Higher.
Basic represents a basic or standard level of ability and understanding.

**A**dept: Roll 3 or higher.
Adept stats represent a level of capability typical to that of a prodigy or someone who's innately gifted.

**S**uperb: Roll 2 or higher.
Superb stats are usually held by geniuses. They're mythical in capability and rarely if every seen.

Note that the first letter of each level of Quality is bold here. That's because in Arrata we refer to a level of Quality by the capital first letter, so a Superb skill is an S skill, and an Adept skill is an A skill.

## Defining Stats

Generally speaking, a stat is a statistic, just a value that represents something. Stats in Arrata come in many different varieties, but they're all made up of two components that we just discussed: **Quantity** and **Quality**. Each stat has both of these attributes.

In Arrata, the notation for a stat is \[First letter of Quality]\[Quantity].

For instance, if I had a Stat with a Quality of Superb and Quantity of 10, I would write and say that the stat was an **S10**.
A stat that's Basic with a Quantity of 4 is a **B4**.
A stat that's Adept with a Quantity of 9889 is a **A9889**.

### Rolling Stats - Successes

Now that we can define any stat within a new notation, let's look at rolling it. We can refered to before on how Quantity was defined, that being a number which represented the number of d6s to be rolled.

Quality is how high we have to roll on each die for that die to be counted as a **success**.

Bringing those together, when a roll is made, two things happen;

1. The number of dice is counted and rolled.
2. Each die is inspected and successes are counted.

Let's look at a few examples:
> I have a B5 in Archery and fire at Todd. Assuming Todd is perfectly spherical and unable to defend himself, I roll 5d6 and get the following results; *3*, **4**, *2*, **6**, **5**. Because my skill is a B5, I need a 4 or more on a die for to be a success, and thus I count 3 successes!

> This asshole George is shooting arrows at me! I have an A4 in Speed and use it to dodge the arrows, so I roll 4d6 and get the following results: *1*, **3**, **3**, **6**. Since I have an A(dept) in the stat, anything 3 and above is a success, so I got 3 successes!

> These two morons are fighting eachother, and I want to see what they have on them to know if I should hang around and pick off whatever's left on the corpse. I roll my S7 in Perception to see what they have and get the following results: **2**, *1*, **3**, **4**, **2**, **5**, *1* Since I have a **S**uperb in my stat, all 2s and above are counted as successes. I got 5 successes!

### Rolling Stats - Obstacle

Great, we can  define how well a roll goes. Now we need to define what we should compare that to. Enter **Obstacle** (Ob).

Ob determines *how many successes are required to succeed*, and how difficult a task is to complete. You need only reach the Ob on a Check to succeed, but getting more can often be beneficial.

In addition, we can set an Ob using another character's roll - their successes determine our Obstacle.

When we refer to an Obstacle, the nomenclature is to say "Ob /[level of the Obstacle]. A task that has an Obstacle of 4 would be refered to as an Ob 4 task.

Let's go back to those examples and see who succeeded.

> I shot an arrow at Todd and got 3 successes! Since he made no effort to contest my shot, the Ob of the check was 0. Since 3 >= 0, my check was a success and I hit him!

> That asshole shot at me! I used my Speed to avoid the arrow, and got 3 successes. But since he got 3 successes and I was setting the Obstacle for him to shoot, he hit me regardless!

> Moron 2 got hit. My GM told me the Ob for the Perception check was 4, and since I got 5 successes I succeed. The idiot currently bleeding out had a sizable coinpurse and some expensive jewelry. Perhaps that's why Moron 1 was shooting at him. Guess I'll have to see what I can pick off when Moron 1 leaves.

### Open-Ended vs Close-Ended Rolls

In Arrata, you will most likely come across a modifier specifying that a roll be **Open-Ended**. This refers to how the dice function after a roll is already made.

Close-Ended rolls are rolls we've already discussed - when a die is rolled, you simply look at the value it comes up as and determine if it's a success or failure. Nothing fancy here.

Open-Ended rolls function the same, *except when you roll a 6*. If a roll is Open-Ended, any 6s are counted as successes and give you +1D to roll again. In effect, you reroll any 6s and keep the success. This can happen for the same die theoretically infinitely, although the odds also seem to tend to infinitely more impossible odds.

### Advantage

There will eventually be a situation in which performing an action might seem easier than it usually would be - you have some sort of significant **Advantage**. Things like exploiting your environment, having a helpful Quirk, having specific tools, etc. usually call for your roll *having Advantage*.

Advantage comes in levels, and provides you with boons for your roll. These levels can be determined mechanically, such as getting levels of Advantage equal to a roll, or having multiple environmental factors assist you in attacking a foe. With the latter, consult your GM and determine just how many levels of Advantage are called for.

The first level of Advantage makes your roll Open-Ended, which as said before, means you get to count any 6s as successes and roll them again, effectively gaining +1D to the roll.

With further levels of Advantage, you gain +1D to your roll.

For intsance, with 3 levels of Advantage, my roll is both Open-Ended and gains +2D.

It's also important to note that Open-Ended rolls include all dice being rolled, so dice being added by Advantage are also Open-Ended given that the roll is Open-Ended. Let's look at an example:

> Todd jumped into a pile of leaves? What? Well, the GM said since he did that, I get 3 levels of Advantage so we'll take it. I've got a B5 in Archery, but since I've got 3 levels of Advantage that becomes a B7! Let's roll and see what we get: *2*, ***6***, **4**, **5**, *1*,**3**, **4**. Wow! I got 5 successes, but even better, I rolled a 6! That means I get to roll that die again! I roll and it became a **4**, that's another success! We add that on and now I've got 6 successes!

### Disadvantage

In the same manner we got Advantage, we can do the opposite to impose **Disadvantage**. Disadvantage comes in levels much as Advantage does, but applies the opposite effect.

With the first level of Disadvantage, any 1s rolled subtract 1 success from my roll.

With further levels of Disadvantage, I recieve -1D per level.

For instance, if I had 4 levels of Disadvantage while rolling a B6, I'd really be rolling a B3, and any 1s would reduce the number of successes by 1. This one's a little more confusing, so here's an example:

> George just shot at me! I fell into a pile of leaves and now have 2 levels of Disadvantage against his next shot! Well, I've got an A6 in Speed, so let's see what I rolled. With 2 levels of Disadvantage, I'm really rolling an A5, here's the results: ***1***, *2*, **4**, **5**, **6**. I count 3 successes here, but since I have Disadvantage, any 1s reduce that my successes by 1 each, and I rolled a 1! Which means my 3 successes becomes 2... Uh oh.

## Actions, Checks, and Consequence

When you're roleplaying a character, you will have to make decisions. Those decisions are called *Actions*, and what happens as a result of those Actions are the *Consequences*. Not all Actions are equal, some require effort and skill, and for those we use **Checks** to determine the outcome.

### Actions -> Consequence: What is a Check?

When a character's action is contested, a series of events must occur:

- Establish the **Intent**. What are we trying to *do*?
- Establish the **Obstacle**. What is *contesting* the action?
- Establish the **Expectation**. Based off of the *Intent*, what do we *expect* to happen if we succeed on this Check?
- Establish **Consequences**. What will happen if we meet the *Expectations*? What happens if we don't?
- **Roll**. We roll dice and determine *how much of the Expectation* is met.
- **Consequence** The GM states what the result of the Rolling stage means - did the character complete the action? Did they complete their *Intent*, but not as to our *Expectation* of it?.

When we make a check, the most critical part mechanically is establishing the **Obstacle**, or Ob. It is typically the GM's job to do this - a PC will make an action and the GM will define how hard it is to reach the Expected outcome as an Ob.

Then, the Player rolls their PC's relevant Stat and compares their successes to the Ob - as iterated before, if the successes meet or exceed the Ob, their Expectation is met and the Action *Succeeds*.

However, rolling under the Obstacle will result in *Failure*, but that failure is relative to the Expectation. Every Failure will come with some **Degree of Success**.

### Checks - Degrees of Success

Now that we've established what we use to roll in Arrata and ho

### Checks - Let it Roll

#### Congrats

Those are the fundamentals that make up the basic mechanics of Arrata! With these, you should understand:

- What an action and check are.
  - Actions are decisions you make for your character.
  - Checks happen when an Action is contested in a serious manner and require a roll to defeat.
- Dice Notation.
  - Dice are represented as \[**# of dice being rolled**]d\[**sides of the dice being rolled**]
  - When we add or subtract dice, we use +/-\[**# of dice**]
- Dice pools/Quantity.
  - Quantity is the attribute of a stat that determines how many d6s to roll.
- Quality.
  - Quality comes in 3 levels: **B**asic, **A**dept, and **S**uperb. It's the attribute of a stat that determines the minimum a die must be rolled to for it to be counted as a success.
- Successes and Failures.
  - Successes are dice that have been rolled at or past the Quality, Failures are dice that are rolled under the Quality.
- Obstacle (Ob).
  - Obstacle is how many successes are needed as a minimum for the check to be passed successfully. Additional successes can offer additional potential, though.
- What a stat is.
  - Stats are a value that represent something. In Arrata, a stat is made up of \[**Q**uality]\[**Quantity**].
- Open-Ended Rolls and Close-Ended Rolls.
  - Open-Ended Rolls allow give you +1D for every 6 rolled.
  - Close-Ended Rolls do not give you anything special, what you roll initially is what you get.
- Advantage and Disadvantage.
  - Advantage makes rolls Open-Ended and grants +1D for every level past the first.
  - Disadvantage makes 1s subtract from the total number of successes, and reduces the dice you roll by -1D per level past the first.
