# II - Fundamentals
### Actions, Consequence, and Checks
When you're roleplaying a character, you will have to make decisions. Those decisions are called *Actions*, and what happens as a result of those Actions is called the *Consequence*. Not all Actions are equal, some require effort and skill, and for those we use **Checks**. 

Checks are a way of providing a level of randomness and realistic challenge to the game.

When a Check is encountered, we roll dice to determine if the character making the Action is able to do it and compares it to a 

#### Dice Notation
When using and discussing quantities of dice, often the term Dice Notation may be used. This refers to a system that helps define two things about the dice being rolled:<br>
- How many dice are being rolled.
- How many sides the dice being rolled have.

This is represented as [# of dice being rolled]**d**[sides of the dice being rolled].
For instance, if you wanted to roll 3 dice with 20 sides each, you'd say you were rolling 3d20 and pronounce it "*three-dee-twenty*".

In addition, if you see +1D or -1D, this refers to adding or subtracting 1 from the [# of dice being rolled]. 
For instance, if you were rolling 3d20 -1D, you're really rolling 2d20. If you rolled 3d20 +1D, you're rolling 4d20. 

#### Dice Pools - Quantity
Arrata is an RPG system that relies on **dice pools**, using the **d6** or *6-sided-die*.
This means that a number representing a stat or skill is the number representing how many 6-sided-dice are to be rolled when using that stat or skill.

This number shall be refered to as **Quantity** - the number of dice to be rolled. 

In dice notation, this makes up the [#of dice to be rolled] section, which we can shorten to [*Quantity*]d6, as again, Arrata uses the d6 for its dice rolls.

#### Success and Failure - Quality
Any action that is opposed is to be met with
