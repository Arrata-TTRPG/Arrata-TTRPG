# II - Fundamentals
## Actions, Consequence, and Checks
When you're roleplaying a character, you will have to make decisions. Those decisions are called *Actions*, and what happens as a result of those Actions is called the *Consequence*. Not all Actions are equal, some require effort and skill, and for those we use **Checks**. 

Checks are a way of providing a level of randomness and realistic challenge to the game.

When a Check is encountered occurs, the character whose actions were contested will roll a relevant *Stat* or *Skill* to determine the outcome.

#### Dice Notation
When using and discussing quantities of dice, often the term Dice Notation may be used. This refers to a system that helps define two things about the dice being rolled:<br>
- How many dice are being rolled.
- How many sides the dice being rolled have.

This is represented as [# of dice being rolled]**d**[sides of the dice being rolled].
For instance, if you wanted to roll 3 dice with 20 sides each, you'd say you were rolling 3d20 and pronounce it "*three-dee-twenty*".

In addition, if you see +1D or -1D, this refers to adding or subtracting 1 from the [# of dice being rolled]. 
For instance, if you were rolling 3d20 -1D, you're really rolling 2d20. If you rolled 3d20 +1D, you're rolling 4d20. 

## Dice Pools - Quantity
Arrata is an RPG system that relies on **dice pools**, using the **d6** or *6-sided-die*.
This means that a number representing a stat or skill is the number representing how many 6-sided-dice are to be rolled when using that stat or skill.

This number shall be refered to as **Quantity** - the number of dice to be rolled. 

In dice notation, this makes up the [#of dice to be rolled] section, which we can shorten to [*Quantity*]d6, as again, Arrata uses the d6 for its dice rolls.

Quality represents how much work a person can do with a stat or skill, along with how knowledgable they are in the subject.

## Success and Failure - Quality
With dice pools, a critical mechanic is called **Quality**, this value determines the odds of each die being rolled. It defines how high each die must be rolled to as a minimum for said die to be counted as a **Success**. Any dice not considered a success are called **Failures**.

There are 3 levels of Quality. From least to most:

**B**asic: Roll 4 or Higher.
Basic represents a basic or standard level of ability and understanding.

**A**dept: Roll 3 or higher.
Adept stats represent a level of capability typical to that of a prodigy or someone who's innately gifted.

**S**uperb: Roll 2 or higher.
Superb stats are usually held by geniuses. They're mythical in capability and rarely if every seen.

Note that the first letter of each level of Quality is bold here. That's because in Arrata we refer to a level of Quality by the capital first letter, so a Superb skill is an S skill, and an Adept skill is an A skill.

## Defining Stats
When we refer to the word "stat", there are two meanings.

Generally speaking, a stat is a statistic, just a value that represents something. Stats in Arrata come in many different varieties, but they're all made up of two components that we just discussed: **Quantity** and **Quality**. Each stat has both of these attributes.

In Arrata, the notation for a stat is \[First letter of Quality]\[Quantity]. 

For instance, if I had a Stat with a Quality of Superb and Quantity of 10, I would write and say that the stat was an **S10**.
A stat that's Basic with a Quantity of 4 is a **B4**.
A stat that's Adept with a Quantity of 9889 is a **A9889**.
