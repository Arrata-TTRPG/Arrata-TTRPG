# I - Fundamentals
## Introduction
### What is Arrata?
The word Arrata is a misspelling of errata, the plural of erratum; a list of mistakes in a written document.

Entomology aside, Arrata is a Tabletop-Roleplaying (TTRPG) system with a focus on meaningful characters and their development. To enphasize, Arrata is a <i>system</i>, designed with tools to allow it to be used in many different settings. There some tools for playing in more fantastical settings provided, but Arrata is certainly not limited to them.

### What is Roleplaying?
Roleplaying is the act of putting yourself in the shoes of someone else. It's a form of improv where your job is to emulate and represent a character. There are many parts to roleplaying, such as the accent the character has, the ways they interact with different people, how they solve problems, etc.

Anyone roleplaying a character should know as much about that character as they can if they hope to provide a reliable and accurate representation of them, and Arrata provides many tools that allow you to do this, along with helping you develop that character as they experience new things.

### Game Masters (GMs)
Game Masters (GMs) are a critical part of any roleplaying system. Their job is to:
- Understand the system as thoroughly as possible.
- Roleplay Non-Player Characters (NPCs, also called Non-Playable Characters).
- Be courteous and fair to their Players.
- Provide a story and setting.
- Describe:
	- the outcomes of rolls,
	- the environment,
	- reactions and consequences,
	- everything that isn't already known and is wanted to be know.

In effect, the GM's job is to be the world-engine, describing and defining what the world is, how it looks, and how it interacts with the players and their actions.

As a GM, you have the most amount of responsibility as you must know and/or improv everything the players and their characters will come to discover in your world. You also have the most amount of power, and it's your job to act as a mediator if any disagreement or argument happens related to the game. The GM's rulings are absolute, so be sure to write them down if you know you'll come across them again.

GMs also typically orchestrate Campaigns and Sessions, which is an added layer of responsibility. To compensate this, they are afforded the right to remove Players they think won't make a good fit and/or who are being a nusance to the group.

### Players and their Characters (PCs)
Players are people whose job is to roleplay their character, they are the dependant variable of the game.

That may seem simple, but being a player has a lot different demands and expectations, including but not limited to:
- Roleplaying their character.
- Being courteous to the Game Master and fellow players.
- Knowing the rules within reason.
- Following the rules and decisions of the Game Master.
- Being honest about rolls and their character sheet.

Being a bad player is more than enough reason for a Game Master to remove them from their game - as a player you are owed nothing but the fate your rolls provide you.

That doesn't mean that rolling bad should get you kicked - being an asshole will. Be reasonable, be understand, and communicate with your GM if you have questions or concerns.

On top of being a Player, you are assigned a **Player Character** (PC), which you will often times have the ability to create yourself. Your PC is the way in which you interact with the world, so do try to keep good care of them.

In order to know what and who your PC is, you should probably record the information somewhere, perhaps on the [Official Arrata Character sheet]()?

### How Should I Play Arrata?
Arrata can be played in many different ways, but kind amongst them is the TT part of TTRPG; Sitting at a table with friends (or soon-to-be friends). Being face-to-face offers a lot of advantages in how you roleplay your character and act as a Game Master, not to mention how it can help you grow your social skills. It also allows you to roll dice and use your character sheet rather easily with people who can help and answer questions immediately next to you.

However, there are situations where being in-person is impossible. As such, there are many platforms online that can offer you solutions, specifically those that allow Voice chat capabilities. Playing Arrata over text is not advised as you can often lose out on the nuances and fun that real-time roleplay offer, but it is possible.

There are also dice rolling capabilities online that are easily accessed that can help offer a solution if a GM does not trust or want their Players rolling in an incognito manner.

### Sessions
Like many TTRPGs, it's advised to play Arrata in **sessions**. That is, getting everyone playing the game together and play for an extended period, usually for a minimum of an hour and up to 4, though I've certainly gone far past that. Some people have 24-hour sessions which is a bit much.

Make sure to get up and stretch when playing for extended periods of time - dying of a blood clot might not be modeled in Arrata, but it is in real life.

### A Quick Note - Division
Whenever any division or decimal value is made in this document (½, ⅓, etc.) always round up if the decimal is 0.5 or higher and always round down if the decimal is less than 0.5. 
\>= ½ -> 1
\< ½ -> 0

## Fundamentals
### Actions, Consequence, and Checks
When you're roleplaying a character, you will have to make decisions. Those decisions are called *Actions*, and what happens as a result of those Actions is called the *Consequence*. Not all Actions are equal, some require effort and skill, and for those we use **Checks**. 

Checks are a way of providing a level of randomness and realistic challenge to the game.

When a Check is encountered, we roll dice to determine if the character making the Action is able to do it and compares it to a 

#### Dice Notation
When using and discussing quantities of dice, often the term Dice Notation may be used. This refers to a system that helps define two things about the dice being rolled:<br>
- How many dice are being rolled.
- How many sides the dice being rolled have.

This is represented as [# of dice being rolled]**d**[sides of the dice being rolled].
For instance, if you wanted to roll 3 dice with 20 sides each, you'd say you were rolling 3d20 and pronounce it "*three-dee-twenty*".

In addition, if you see +1D or -1D, this refers to adding or subtracting 1 from the [# of dice being rolled]. 
For instance, if you were rolling 3d20 -1D, you're really rolling 2d20. If you rolled 3d20 +1D, you're rolling 4d20. 

#### Dice Pools - Quantity
Arrata is an RPG system that relies on **dice pools**, using the **d6** or *6-sided-die*.
This means that a number representing a stat or skill is the number representing how many 6-sided-dice are to be rolled when using that stat or skill.

This number shall be refered to as **Quantity** - the number of dice to be rolled. 

In dice notation, this makes up the [#of dice to be rolled] section, which we can shorten to [*Quantity*]d6, as again, Arrata uses the d6 for its dice rolls.

#### Success and Failure - Quality
Any action that is opposed is to be met with
