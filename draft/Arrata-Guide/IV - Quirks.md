# IV - Quirks

Quirks are critical core pillars of every character. They make up ***who they are***, defining how they interact with the environment and other people, how society sees them, how they act and justify actions, and much more.

## Structure

Quirks are made up of 4 elements:

- Name: The name of the Quirk.
- Defines: Different interpretations and possible meanings of the Quirk, specific to roleplaying scenarios.
- Boons: Ways in which the Quirk can be used to your Advantage.
- Flaws: Ways the Quirk can work towards your Disadvantage.

Here's an example Quirk with the elements highlighted:

> **Name**: *Veritable*
>
> **Defines**:
>
> - Being a genuine article or item.
> - A real instance of something believed gone or impossible.
> - Acting genuinely or truthfully.
>
> **Boons**: People will often trust or believe you.
>
> **Flaws**: You may often disclose things you should not.



## Quirk Categories

Quirks are split into 3 categories. This allows for a degree of specificity and verification as Quirks that don't fit into any of these categories tend to make poor Quirks.

### Ethos

Ethos Quirks express a characterâ€™s Ethical, Moral, Societal, and Religious beliefs and context. Often it contains information about their past and how they're currently seen by the society they live in today.

### Pathos

Pathos deals with a character's emotional situation - how they act around other people and with what level of apathy or empathy they approach different tasks. It tends to define things that may seem simple but can be used in much more nuanced ways when combined with other Quirks.

### Logos

Logos is how a character makes decisions; how they choose to solve problems and treat other people.

Many Logos and Pathos Quirks are very similar, but their differentiation lies in what level they derive their reasoning for an action. Logos Quirks are innate - Pathos Quirks are artifacts of personality and culture.

### Complexity

The incredible value of Quirks is that they're not isolated. As a person roleplaying a character, it is your job to combine and mesh these Quirks and define exactly what they mean and how they *work together*.

For a basic example, consider the following:

> You're a GM making a villain for the story and you know you want to give them the Pathos **Anarchist** Quirk as it best represents their rejection of authority and generally chaotic, lawless nature. 
>
> You want at least one more Quirk for now, and would prefer it be a Logos Quirk, and so you begin looking through the provided Quirklist that was so lovingly curated.
> 
> Suddenly, a Quirk catches your eye! **Eloquent** - this villian will be articulate and dignified. This villain will speak in a fanciful manner; in fact they've exploited their impressive speech to reach high into the stratems of society as part of their master plan.

You can see how quickly you can build synergy with Quirks, and they can often help you easily form the background for a character before they're even fully realized. If you're not sure where to start with a character, slamming a few disparate Quirks together might be an excellent way to get the wheel rolling.

### Intuition

**Intuition** is experience gained from accomplishing tasks that *oppose Quirks*. It's measured in individual points for each Quirk category.



### Challenges
